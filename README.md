The model will iterate through the men and women. 
Each person has an attribute `prob_seek` that decides if he/she wants to look for a date in this period.
If he/she decides to look for a date, 
a number of candidates will be probabilistically selected from all women/men that are not dating with someone,
according to their social spending.

`prob_seek`: probability of looking for a date.

Figures:

* bar chart: distribution of accumulated days in a relationship of all persons
