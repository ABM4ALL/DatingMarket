# DatingMarket

The model is an example for using the `Melodie` and `tab2dict` packages to develop agent-based models. In the project folder, you can find a local installation file of `Melodie`. Please install this one instead of using `pip install Melodie` to install the online version directly. We are now updating the package and this is the latest version working for this `DatingMarket` model.
